    <div id="paragraphsmeow" style="font-size: 20px;">
        <div class="container3">
            <p>I love you so much baby, I could've gone on and on about, why I love you, why I love your pretty face, and why I love your perfect body (if you want me to go on longer I will for sure I just didn't know how much text you'd be wanting to read), I love seeing your personality, your pretty face, and your perfect body. I've been so in love with you for months, and I really want to be married to you, and we will get married in the future baby. I love you for so so many reasons, I could go on forrreverrrr, the things i listed above wasn't everything at all.</p>
            <p>You make me feel things I could never explain in a way to give it justice, just the fact that you're alive and you're as perfect and lovely as you are is crazy to me, and the fact that you love me doesn't make any sense to me, it makes me cry sometimes because it makes zero sense but I am so grateful that I have youu.</p>
            <p>I could never ever leave or stop loving you, from the second I fell in love, I was a regan's boy forever, I could never stop. I was so drawn to you for months before I fell in love, I had never been drawn to someone anywhere near the way I was drawn to you, it didn't make any sense to me at the time, the feelings I felt from you, the way you made me feel, just everything about you, I realize now, that was me falling in love. I was made for you, we're soulmates, I know it. You make me feel so lovely and like a whole echosystem of butterflies live in my stomach and you've made me feel that way since I fell in love.</p>
            <p>You're the best thing I could ever ask for, that anyone could ever ask for. So many things remind me of you, I basically think of you 24/7/365, I am obsessed with you and so in love in a way words could never descirbe, being in love with you is perfect, it feels perfect, and so lovely in a way nobody would ever be able to describe.</p>
            <p>I'm so glad that it's almost winter again. Winter reminds me of you so much, the type of music I listen to during winter reminds me of you so much, basically my life during the period I feel in love with you (I think it started in december) reminds me of you so much, I've been feeling all these things because of the weather, and the music i've been listening to, and I wanna bottle this feeling up, and keep it forever and ever. Falling in love, and being in love feel a little different, but every so often, i'll feel the feeling of falling in love with you, which isn't to say that I ever fall out of love with you, because I don't at all, I think it's just me smelling things, and feeling things I felt during when I was falling in love with you, and whenever I feel the feeling of falling in love with you again, it makes me almost cry, cry of joy. I love feeling that feeling.</p>
            <p>I love that I talk to you everyday, I love that i've been able to talk to you everyday for months, I love that you love me, I love that I love you. I am so lucky to be yours, I am the luckiest person in the whole world. I don't know what I did at all to deserve you, but I'll do anything to keep you. I love you, I love you so much. I am addicted to you, and the way you talk, and the way you dress, and the way you do everything, the way you talk to me, just everything about you baby.</p>
            <p>I love calling you so much, I love hearing your voice, the way you speak, your voice, all of it brings me so much comfort. I think and fantasize about you for hours on end, I fantasize about you so much. I fantasize about you being in my arms or me being in your arms everynight, I fantasize about holding your hand when I'm walking, seeing you smile and laugh, watching the sun sink behind the hills, watching a show or movie with you, if i'm doing something, I am at the same time fantasizing about you being there with me. I love you, I love you so much baby, I dream of you, I yearn for you, I long for you.</p>
            <p>I really can't put into words the way I think of you, the way I think of you feels like listening to a beautiful song on loop but after every loop the song gets prettier and prettier. I love when we talk about our future, I really will do anything to make these things we talk about happen baby, to travel the world with you, to buy a home somewhere perfect for the both of us, to adopt cats, all of these things we talk about I really really plan on making happen. I can't wait until my fantasies about you, cooking with you, watching movies with you, going on dates with you, holding your hand, all of these things become a reality. Thinking about it makes me tear up.</p>
            <p>I so often think about the times we've watched movies together just you and me, and how those nights made me feel, and the way they made me feel is something I can't describe, the best way to describe it is unfathomably lovely, we're soulmates baby, I am sure of it, so sure of it. I cherish moments I get to talk to you uninterrupted, they feel like the lovliest thing ever. And I love it, I love you. Every time I see your name pop up on my phone, my whole day gets better. I imagine what it'll be like to finally hold you and never let go.</p>
            <p>You mean so much to me, so much in a way I could never explain correctly, no one ever could, never feel like a burden to me my love, you could never burden me, never ever. I hope you believe that, it's true, it makes me so happy when you come to me without me asking to tell me what's wrong, and even if I have to ask it still makes me so happy when you tell me, I care so deeply about you, I love you so much, How could someone I love soooo insanely deeply burden me? you can't baby, remember that my love.</p>
            <!-- this is what i want her to read last (so add all other text above here) -->
            <p>I hope you like the idea of a website as a gift, I thought of it because i've always wanted to write you notes, but I can't, and this is kind of like a note but on the internet I guess, I thoguht it was kind of cool becuase it'll stay up as long as I am paying for the domain and I can keep it up forever probably because it's really cheap for a domain</p>
            <p>The last thing I wanna say is, even though you have all these great physical qualities I still love you for you baby, for the wonderful, talented, lovely, kind, sweet and so much more, person you are. You're the love of my life now, and forever baby </p>
            <p>This website is me saying I love you, forever and always, as long as I'm alive, so is my love for you.</p>
